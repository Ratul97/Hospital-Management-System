            <h2>Covid Alert!</h2>
            <p>Since March 2020, Bangladesh has been experiencing multiple stages of COVID-19 pandemic not only impacting the health sector with the infections & fatalities. The COVID-19 induced containment measures, especially lockdowns, have intensified the needs of vulnerable groups especially in informal sectors in terms of their livelihood. Many people have lost their jobs and income sources, resulting an increase in unemployment and poverty in both urban and rural areas throughout the country. Those who have less/no access to social protection, smaller savings or limited alternative sources of income both in urban and rural settings are the most affected ones. This study tries to identify some of the impacts that COVID-19 has imposed on different sectors especially livelihood and access to health including the vaccine hesitancy among the population. </p>

            <h2>Dengue Outbreak</h2>
            <p>The global dengue disease burden has increased significantly over the last five decades, but has primarily affected the Southeast Asia (SEAR) and Western Pacific (WPRO) Regions. In the SEAR, Bangladesh has experienced periodic episodes of dengue outbreaks each year. Although two serotypes of dengue  were predominant in prior decades, Bangladeshi officials have recently detected a rise in a third serotype, which drove a rapid surge in dengue cases throughout 2021. The country has reported high mortality this year from dengue compared to its previous epidemic in 2019, coined as its deadliest dengue outbreak in history. This weekâ€™s Outbreak Thursday will discuss the current dengue outbreak in Bangladesh driven by the dangerous third variant as well as the efforts of national and local health authorities to slow down the outbreak.

Diarrhea is the second leading cause of mortality for children under the age of five. It is capable of killing more than 1,300 children every day or almost 500,000 children annually. While the numbers are staggering, numerous countries all around the world have made great strides with Bangladesh taking the lead. Certainly, the defeat of diarrhea in Bangladesh is the exemplar of a successful fight against this deadly killer. Below are some indicators and explanations of how Bangladesh defeated diarrhea.</p>
